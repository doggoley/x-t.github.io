		<h1>RIP Terry A. Davis</h1>
		<p>August 11th marks the 1 year of his passing.</p>
		<p>It is a shame such a man had to die, he was an idol to me. I feel like many people can learn a lot from him. His demise, his work.</p>
		<p>It takes a lot of dedication, patience and intellect to create a fully fledged OS single handedly over 10 years.</p>
		<p>And although I may have 1/20th of these, he still made me strive for these values.</p>
		<p>Light a candle in his honor.</p>
		<p>I am also reopening a small archive of Terry's stuff I have collected. <a href="terry/index.html">Check it here.</a></p>

	<p>I'm a 16 y/o student from Lithuania.</p>
	<p>Used to be a developer. Although I still didn't <i>completely</i> lose interest.</p>
	<p>I absolutely hate hugboxing. I try to be as honest as possible, which sometimes means even bad things.</p>
	<p>The internet went down the shitter, I made this site as a way to leave a mark in this centralized mess.</p>
	<p>I like messing with technology, sipping boomer monster and remembering the good ol' days.</p>
