<pre>[05-01 02:01 pm] <b>Anonymous</b>:  Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called &quot;Linux&quot; distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux. </pre><pre>[05-01 02:01 pm] <b>Anonymous</b>: The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system</pre><pre>[05-01 02:00 pm] <b>Anonymous</b>: There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. </pre><pre>[05-01 02:00 pm] <b>Anonymous</b>: Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called &quot;Linux&quot;, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.</pre><pre>[05-01 01:59 pm] <b>Anonymous</b>: Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it.</pre><pre>[05-01 01:59 pm] <b>Anonymous</b>: Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.</pre><pre>[05-01 01:59 pm] <b>Anonymous</b>: What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux</pre><pre>[05-01 01:59 pm] <b>Anonymous</b>: &quot;I'd just like to interject for a moment.</pre><pre>[04-18 04:33 pm] <b>dm4</b>: very pink very nice </pre><pre>[04-15 07:09 pm] <b>gay</b>: but this guestbook is nice</pre><pre>[04-15 07:08 pm] <b>gay</b>: this site is gay</pre><pre>[04-13 02:27 pm] <b>first</b>: haha yes</pre>    </div>
