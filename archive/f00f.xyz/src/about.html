        <h1>About me</h1>
        <h3>Hello, NSA!</h3>
        <p>I'm a high school student from Lithuania. In my free time, I either program, experiment with OSes or just waste that time.</p>
        <p>I have a strange habit of using about a million nicknames. You can call me with all of the ones you may remember or see here.</p>
        <h3>Specializations</h3>
        <p>I can write stuff. Probably the most complex project I made (from scratch) was okforms, a Google Forms knockoff (see the table below).</p>
        <p>I know a few languages, however I'm not stuck with only a few and can learn one fairly quickly.</p>
        <p>I also have some experience in system administration. It wasn't anything big, but I learnt valuable shit.</p>
        <h3>Interests</h3>
        <p>Computers, engineering, politics.</p>
        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>I like metal and rock, when I'm feeling calmer I prefer ambient.</p>
        <p>I don't really have a genre I'd despise.</p>
