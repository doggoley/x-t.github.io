<p>Arch is probably the worst piece of shit I've ever used and the community around it is even shittier. The amount of shit in this one is an absolute behemoth. I cannot ever bother retesting this shit because this is shit.</p>

<h2>Packages</h2>
<p>Packages in Arch aren't split into anything, there are channels but nobody cares to use them. The real split is the main repository and the AUR. The main repository is sometimes more outdated than FreeBSD or Void, absolute meme. The AUR is also an absolute meme. The only purpose it serves is that Arch is too lazy to get actual package maintainers and maintain more packages than they do in the main repo.</p>
<p>The AUR's architecture is non-existant. The only thing standardized is "run this script", and this is what AUR managers really do. These aren't even packages most of the time. Sometimes these download a binary, sometimes they completely compile from source. Unlike in portage or apt, you don't know what you're going to get, it's a mess. Honestly I ended up getting tarballs just to avoid messing with that horseshit. I would rather use Slackware.</p>
<p>Not to mention that pacman is also a pile of shit, it's so shit it's an actual meme. Ever heard "Xorg breaking"? That's because it's fucking true. pacman is so shit it forgets that configs exist and you end up with a broken system. Some Xorg updates broke Xorg. Some Python updates deleted all Python configuration files. Other updates broke entire systems. Personally Arch fucked all my dynamic libraries, so no application worked at all. No way to get it back other than reinstalling. This is why I found out that Archfags keep the /home partition seperate from /, because they keep reinstalling their system so fucking often.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>There's no installer. You have to follow the instructions on the wiki, which doesn't sound so bad until you remember "fuck, wasn't this longer?". And yes, it was. Archfags hate newfags so much they decided to shorten the FUCK out of the install guide just because why not? They removed some pretty useful information just for no reason. I mean, yes, you'll get an install working, but you won't go as far.</p>

<h2>Usability</h2>
<h4>Advanced use</h4>
<p>Arch is haxxor loonix so you can do absolutely nothing other than post neofetches all fucking day long because you have no life.</p>
<h4>Simple use</h4>
<p>No newfags are allowed into Arch, read the fucking manual newfag, you should go back to Noobuntu you fucktard!</p>

<h2>Where is Arch used?</h2>
<p>r/unixporn and desktop threads. It's not used anywhere else because it's a trash distro.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p class="procon"><em>+ is a pro, ? is a mixed opinion, - is a con</em></p>
<p>+ It has pretty up to date software</p>
<p>+ A pretty informative wiki, although IMO Gentoo's is better</p>
<p>- pacman is trash</p>
<p>- The AUR is trash</p>
<p>- The community is AIDS</p>
<p>- No installer</p>
<p>- No package splitting. Come on, Arch, can't you do -dev packages?</p>
<p>I spent a full year on Arch. A year. Please fucking kill me. It's an AIDS distro with an AIDS community. It's the only distro that I will never install in the entirety of my life. I hate it so much I want it to die. But I also don't want it to die. It's a "so bad it's good" thing. It keeps all these elitist assholes in one place, so keep the distro up, I'll shit on it, but thanks for existing.</p>
