<p>FreeBSD, IMO, is the second best OS that UNIX has to offer. It's the best BSD out of them all and it beats all Linux distros by a good margin. Although, being a pretty small operating system (community-wise), there are definitely support issues.</p>

<h2>Packages</h2>
<p>Basically Linux ports. There's nothing special here, some packages are outdated, some don't work, some aren't ported. If you find a feature that doesn't work due to the developer base being 16 people, they'll basically tell you to fix it yourself.</p>
<p>pkgng is my favorite package manager by far, it never broke, the commands make sense, I had no complaints. This is a far shot from xbps or apt which made by butthole sore.</p>
<p>I guess you could make more shit work on it via the Linux compatibility layer, but I never got it working.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>The installer is fine. The hardware support isn't.</p>
<p>Practically, if it doesn't work out of the box, there isn't much to do other than to write your own drivers.</p>

<h2>Usability</h2>
<h4>Advanced use</h4>
<p>Exactly as Linux. It comes completely minimal out of the box with you having to install a DE yourself.</p>
<p>Other than that, you'll need to learn a few things like /etc/rc.conf, but other than that, it's exactly the same.</p>
<h4>Simple use</h4>
<p>No.</p>

<h2>Where is FreeBSD used?</h2>
<p>Three people and two companies' servers. The entire point of FreeBSD is that they got cucked by Sony (PS3) and Apple (macOS).</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p class="procon"><em>+ is a pro, ? is a mixed opinion, - is a con</em></p>
<p>+ Best software support out of BSDs</p>
<p>+ Best hardware support out of BSDs</p>
<p>+ Appeals to boomers because it's UNIX</p>
<p>? Linux compatibility layer is cool, but I never got it to work.</p>
<p>- CoC</p>
<p>- Community of AIDS (literally faggots)</p>
<p>- Broken software</p>
<p>- Small community (software fixes will never come)</p>
<p>All in all, I kinda like it, it's the cleanest cumrag of them all.</p>
