<p>9front is probably the most niche operating system you can think of. There's a community on it called cat-v and the operating system itself is as terrible as the people.</p>

<h2>Packages</h2>
<p>There are none.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>It does have an installer. It's just a stupid script but at least it does have something.</p>
<p>Hardware support is... let's say if you have anything newer than a Core 2 Duo, it's not supported.</p>

<h2>Usability</h2>
<h4>Advanced use</h4>
<p>What are you gonna use it for? It has no software</p>
<h4>Simple use</h4>

<h2>Where is 9front used?</h2>
<p>I think there's one server somewhere that uses it. 9front is really just a research OS without any purpose other than reading it's horrid source code. Other than that, the developers use Windows or OpenBSD.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p class="procon"><em>+ is a pro, ? is a mixed opinion, - is a con</em></p>
<p>+ You can learn a thing</p>
<p>- It's so useless I can't even consider it a fucking OS at this point</p>
<p>- Shit community</p>

<p>Jackass-tier challenge: use this as your main for a week.</p>
