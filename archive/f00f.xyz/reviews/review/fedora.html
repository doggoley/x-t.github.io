<p><em>This review was written a long time ago and kept here for historical reasons, this isn't as strong as the other ones.</em></p>

<p>
Fedora is a distro managed by the Fedora Project and sponsored by Red Hat.
It's commonly described as "a free version of Red Hat Linux". While to some
extent that might be true, CentOS would come closer, because Fedora is a lot
more up to date than Red Hat Linux and more designed for the desktop.
</p>

<h2>Packages</h2>
<p>
yum is deprecated and dnf is here to replace it, practically - it's really
the same thing, but with a few more features that I can't track down.
The package selection is pretty big, but there are some issues. For example,
to get media playback on any browser you'd need to use rpmfusion to install
the plugins. It's also quite sluggish. They don't have any destinction between
free, contrib or nonfree software, resulting in it not being freedom-respecting,
if you're into that sort of thing.
</p>
<p>
There is no issue about out of date software, some software is older than let's
say for example, Arch, but the stable release is up to date and if you want even
newer software you can try out Rawhide, which is a rolling release of the latest
Fedora features.
</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
The installer is the same thing you'd find in Red Hat, it's straight forward,
with a few options and gets the job done.
</p>
<p>
Install media consists of Workstation, Server and Atomic. I'll focus on the
Workstation release, since that's the only one I had any experience with.
</p>
<p>
There is the regular GNOME version, spins and netinstall, the netinstall has
the most options and the other ones just install the system, so there's nothing
much to them.
</p>

<h2>Usability</h2>
<h4>Advanced use</h4>
<p>
It works well, just set it up and keep updating - because those updates keep
comming regularly. Also there is definitely some stuff to fix, like enabling
rpmfusion to make things work.
</p>
<h4>Simple use</h4>
<p>
Setting up Fedora for someone computer illiterate will definitely be a challenge,
but the difficulty of setting it up shouldn't be any harder than Windows, just repalce
drivers with media libraries. For daily use, it comes with a bunch of GUI tools
and software that should make the job of using it easy.
</p>

<h2>Where is Fedora used?</h2>
<p>
For one, Linus Torvalds uses it to maintain his kernel. Fedora tries to hit
the desktop as well as the server at the same time, it's quite a good distro
for daily use, but I don't really know how popular Fedora is in the server
department.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p class="procon"><em>+ is a pro, ? is a mixed opinion, - is a con</em></p>
<p>
+ Easy to install
<br>
+ Trusted by a lot of people
<br>
+ Up to date
<br>

- Additional repos (rmpfusion) are required to make things work
<br>
- Pretty bloated
<br>
- Some controversial ones: systemd, GNU
<br>
