<p>Haiku is an interesting project. It's like 9front that got somewhere. It's practically the only alternative operating system that has any hope, however tiny that is.</p>

<h2>Packages</h2>
<p>No GTK port. Only a Qt one, even then, there is quite little you can do on it. Honestly, the amount of already existing software that's ported to it is already astonishing for me, considering just how small the operating system is. There are some games ported, like OpenTTD to give the OS a bit more meaning, but the fact is that it's nowhere near production.</p>
<p>Haiku, like FreeBSD, splits itself into two parts - third party packages and the system. This means that you can have an older, more stable system (like r1beta1) without having packages lag behind, because they're always rolling.</p>
<p>I have no issues with Haiku Depot, it's probably my favorite software center, as every other one feels just not right.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>The r1beta1 image can install. On some hardware. Most drivers are pulled from FreeBSD, so the hardware support can be actually better than some other BSDs, like DragonFly or OpenBSD. However, the beta is outdated at this point, so it's always better to use a nightly image. Some boot, some don't, some have unknown issues after booting. It's a mess really.</p>

<h2>Usability</h2>
<h4>Advanced use</h4>
<p>I wouldn't use this OS for regular day use, it just doesn't have enough software to justify its usage.</p>
<h4>Simple use</h4>
<p>This is an OS in constant development, no way.</p>

<h2>Where is Haiku used?</h2>
<p>Nowhere really. It's a desktop OS and it's not ready for production. Linux isn't even close to overtaking anything after all these years. The desktop market is just something else to handle, I don't feel like there is much hope for Haiku there.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p class="procon"><em>+ is a pro, ? is a mixed opinion, - is a con</em></p>
<p>+ Interesting concept</p>
<p>+ Definitely one of the comfiest interfaces I've ever used</p>
<p>+ You can research it, there is definitely some non-POSIX elements there</p>
<p>? Bloated. I feel about this the same way about macOS tho</p>
<p>- Next to no software</p>
<p>- Not ready for general usage</p>

<p>This is an OS I check back a few times over the year, just to see where it got to, because deep down I want it to work out, this has the potential to become an open non-cumrag OS (as far as I know, world's first).</p>
