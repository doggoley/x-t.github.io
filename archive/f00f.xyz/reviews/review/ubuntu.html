<p>Ubuntu is probably the most just-werks distro there is, because it just werks. You pop it in and it werks. It combines everything you need - drivers and software so you don't have to spend an hour installing software.</p>

<h2>Packages</h2>
<p>Ubuntu is the most developed-for platform, because many cross-platform devs do not care about other distros, as Ubuntu is the most popular. This means that not only will you get all Linux's software, you'll also get packaged debs, this means all you'll have to do is double click and the software is installed.</p>
<p>apt, like in Debian, is still shitty, although Ubuntu does look like they're putting in an effort to make it less shitty. By making snappy. The amount of GUI updater/software management tools got annoying for me though.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<h2>Usability</h2>
<h4>Advanced use</h4>
<p>It's Linux, you can do whatever you want.</p>
<p>On my machine though it kept throttling my CPU to shit, this wasn't a problem on any other distros. I also had to reboot my machine to get the speed back. Wtf?</p>
<h4>Simple use</h4>
<p>This is one of those rare distros that your grandpa could maybe use. With enough training and annoying calls at 2AM on why his "photo collection" isn't working, it'll be fine.</p>

<h2>Where is Ubuntu used?</h2>
<p>Desktops for minimalist people who just want a working distro</p>
<p>Servers for sysadmins that cannot fucking bother spending more of their useless time just to set up a distro.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p class="procon"><em>+ is a pro, ? is a mixed opinion, - is a con</em></p>
<p>+ Superb driver and software collection</p>
<p>+ Many debs and PPAs</p>
<p>+ Your grandpa can use it</p>
<p>+ Extremely easy to install</p>
<p>? Bloated. Personally it's not that bad</p>
<p>- Default comes with GNOME, ew</p>
<p>- Suffers from everything that Linux suffers from</p>
<p>- One of the first adopters of systemd. Fuck you.</p>

<p>It's a pretty good OS, but it's not for me.</p>
