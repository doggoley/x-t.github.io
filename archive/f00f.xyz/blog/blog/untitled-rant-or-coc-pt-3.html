<p>In the commit where Linus merged in the CoC to the Linux source code, there <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/8a104f8b5867c682d994ffa7a74093c54469c11f">has been quite a debate</a> on the decision. A lot of people voiced their opinions there, including me.</p>
<p>Ada, the creator of Contributor Trojan Horse, has replied to the thread with multiple points. Since I don't want to reply to the discussion any more, I'll silently write about it in this blog (that may or may not violate GitHub's TOS).</p>
<pre>
My primary goal is to open the doors to success in tech through the gateway of open source by making it an option for as many people as possible. Why this is a debatable point, a point of contention, I don't know: but in the current climate, it makes my position political.
</pre>
<p>A CoC isn't the way to bring more people into tech. The way to bring more people into tech is give them an option to get into the field or not (and they already do), Microsoft's development cycle is teams screaming at each other in cubicles, the development process of Linux is getting an angry letter from a Finnish man because your code is shit.</p>
<p>This is how the climate works, this is how software is made. The only way an argument will never be reached is if you develop the software alone.</p>
<p>If you get offended by that, well then it's not for you, if you can't take an insult over your own shit, I don't think you should be doing anything here anyways. Open source isn't an echochamber, it's not a safezone, if you're bad - you will be called bad.</p>
<pre>
Contributor Covenant is a political document insofar as it prohibits discrimination, and specifically discrimination against the most marginalized and vulnerable members of the tech community. It is a statement against the status quo, which situation does not serve the needs of all people who have something positive to contribute.
</pre>
<p>They're not "marginalized and vulnerable". Open source is a level playing field, whether you're a god-forbidden CIS STRAIGHT WHITE MALE or gay or autistic or identify as a rock, no one cares, if you get work done, you'll get work done. Trying to put these minorities out of work, name them, isn't helping anyone and the minorities are supposed to be treated specially. You're creating ethics codes. "Respect the elderly." No.</p>
<pre>
I am critical of meritocracy, and I am vocal in my criticism. Not so much the concept— the execution. If tech truly is a meritocracy, then why are there so few women and people of color at the top of the hierarchy? Is it really because white men are the best programmers in the world, or are there cultural factors and explicit or implicit biases at play?
</pre>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>People who want to get into the sector are working hard. And these people happen to be cis white males. It's not our issue that women would rather go work as teachers than get into developing software.</p>
<p>Meritocracy is going away either way, because of dipshits like Ada. Many companies now have diversity quotas, meaning if you're really good at engineering, you may not be accepted because on the employer's computer there's a message reading "NOT ENOUGH BLACK PEOPLE".</p>
<p>This is the exact opposite of inclusivity, it's racism. Oh, but it's against <em>white people</em> so it's A-OK!</p>
<pre>
If you truly believe that meritocracy is about valuing the contribution, regardless of the person who made it, why are there personal attacks being made against me here? How are they even relevant? How are my politics relevant?
</pre>
<p>Because your CoC is shit. No one is going after you because you're an autistic tranny. Everyone is going after you because you deserve criticism for your shitty actions.</p>
<p>Your politics are relevant because your CoC is a reflection of those politics. You call your CoC a political document, therefore it is in the play.</p>
<pre>
No one can seriously believe that an infraction of code of conduct will result in an instant ban hammer. Maintainers want healthy communities, filled with brilliant and passionate contributors who get along well and are good communicators and collaborators. They should be trusted to investigate complaints and, if necessary, mete out consequences that are proportional to the offense.
</pre>
<p>Yes because one "transphobic" tweet is a warrant to remove a contributor from a project.</p>
<p>CoCs are trojan horses intended to ban people that you don't like. That's why terms like "hate speech" were pulled out of someone's ass.</p>
<pre>
A code of conduct does not grant any sort of authority to anyone outside the circle of maintainers. So-called "SJWs" are not the arbiters of the code of conduct, the project maintainers are. And guess what? Even without a code of conduct, project maintainers are within their rights to ARBITRARILY eject people from the community. Has this ever happened? Probably not. And it's even less likely to happen now that there is a SOCIAL CONTRACT between the maintainers and the members of the community.
</pre>
<p>That is true to some extent. But a CoC is just an indication that your maintenance is so shit you need a document saying "respect autists".</p>
<pre>
"Opalgate" has been mentioned a few times. I have serious regrets and misgivings about what I did in that situation. I have publicly apologized to both Elia and the project maintainer. And I learned my lesson: since then I have kept out of the politics of projects adopting codes of conduct, leaving it to the maintainers to decide what is best for their communities (as it should be). If you want to know both sides of the opal gate story, you should read my blog post about it: https://where.coraline.codes/blog/on-opalgate/
</pre>
<p>Great that you have learned... most likely nothing. People like you refuse to learn. Instead of shitting up project's issues on people needed to be removed, you're now going on 3 mile rants about the CIS WHITE MEN on Twitter.</p>
<pre>
It's true that I have made a number of critical statements about cis white males. That's because cis white males dominate the tech industry. To make progress, we need to critically examine the behavior of the majority. That doesn't mean that I hate men, hate white people, or hate anyone. My critique is simply of the majority, which happens to be white and male.
</pre>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I'm guessing <a href="https://twitter.com/CoralineAda/status/1029162264979546112">this</a> doesn't exist!</p>
<p>You hate men, you hate white people, you're "criticising" them because you think that they "dominate".</p>
<p>50/50 equality will never, ever, ever be reached in the history of mankind, ever. Own up to that shit or shut the fuck up.</p>
<pre>
I can come across as angry on Twitter. That's my right. As a marginalized person in tech— a woman, transgender, with mental health issues, and significantly older than most of my peers— I face a lot of discrimination. I am a constant target of harassment, including doxing and death threats. A mentorship program that I announced last week was flooded with nearly 200k abusive applications including hate speech, homophobic, transphobic, and racist statements. Contact forms on my various websites have received thousands of abusive messages. So I have plenty to be angry about, and no one can or should police my emotions. They are mine and mine alone. If I want to "throw a tantrum" I am free to do so, within the rules and guidelines of the platform that I am using.
</pre>
<p>Boo-fucking-hoo. If you weren't an SJW twat and didn't contribute horseshit and didn't speak horseshit, maybe you would be respected. But no, you keep talking crap, you keep shoving a cancerous document in everyone's face and just because you're mentally ill and deluded you think that you deserve respect. No. I believe in true equality, and that is one where I can tell you to fuck off, and you can tell me to fuck off.</p>
<br>
<p>Conclusion: everything just got even stupider. I can't wait for this stupid thing to end.</p>
