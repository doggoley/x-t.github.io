<p>Sometimes a man just needs to install Google apps and to remove them afterwards. For example maybe to download something from the play store or to try something out.</p>
<p>After you did your... whatever, you may be staggered to learn that there is no official way to uninstall gapps.</p>
<p>The recommended way is to wipe and reinstall everything, well, not all of us have the time to do that. So, a solution - forcefully uninstall gapps.</p>
<p>Things needed for this -</p>
<ul>
	<li>TWRP</li>
	<li>The same ROM as you currently have (flashable zip)</li>
</ul>
<p>CWM is dead anyway, there is no real reason to use it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
<p>Wipe /system, just go to Wipe -> Advanced wipe -> [x] System -> Wipe</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
<p>Open up the terminal, go to Advanced -> Terminal, and type these</p>
<pre>
# cd /data
# find ./ | grep google | xargs rm -rf
</pre>
<p>(keep in mind # means that it's ran as root, not a comment.)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
<p>Flash your ROM, just make sure that it's the same - dirty flashing different ROMs ends badly most of the time.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
<p>Clear cache/dalvik and reboot!</p>
<br>
<p>There, gapps is now gone. It's a hack, but it works. And it works better than reflashing as this actually deletes gapps, while reinstalling a ROM would just not recognize the already existing gapps.</p>
<p>Not really a tool, but I wish I had known this before I needlessly wiped a few installs.</p>
