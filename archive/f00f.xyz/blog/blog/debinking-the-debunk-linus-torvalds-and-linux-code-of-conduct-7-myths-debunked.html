<p>I've already stated my opinion on the Linux CoC drama/situation, currently we're not having any questions answered but we do keep getting more questions to ask. Anyway, I found <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/linus-torvalds-and-linux-code-of-conduct-myths/">this</a> article which is inherently pro-CoC, which I think is bullshit. Let's go.</p>
<p><strong>Myth 1. The Linux kernel has been taken over by Social Justice Warriors (SJW)!</strong></p>
<p>This is true, it might not have been "taken over", but their presence is now a part of project, as a CoC is a trojan horse.</p>
<p>
<pre>
Hardly! The new CoC is based on Coraline Ada Ehmke's Contributor Covenant, version 1.4. It's been been adopted by many open-source projects such as Eclipse, Ruby, and Kubernetes.
</pre>
</p>
<p>This does not mean that it's not SJW in any way. A large infiltration size does not equal to it not being SJW. It is simply wrong.</p>
<p>
<pre>
Her sarcastic tweet ("I can't wait for the mass exodus from Linux now that it's been infiltrated by SJWs. Hahahah.") helped bring on the flames. 
</pre>
</p>
<p>In what way is it sarcastic? You're implying things here, Ada is a hard-lined SJW that is serious about this shit, trying to shake it of as "hehe it was a joke" is simply wrong.</p>
<p>
<pre>
Torvalds, with other senior Linux kernel developers, added the CoC. No one else did.
</pre>
</p>
<p>Wrong. Greg made it and Torvalds approved the change, see the commit <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/8a104f8b5867c682d994ffa7a74093c54469c11f">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Myth 2. Linus Torvalds left and then adopted the CoC to get ahead of The New Yorker article about his discouraging women from working on the kernel. </strong></p>
<p>You're assuming shit again. State facts or don't fucking talk. We all have questions, don't try to be a Christian and scribble answers in Linus' name.</p>
<p><strong>Myth 3. Nothing is going to change.</strong></p>
<p>Not much should change in terms of the quality of the kernel, unless everything goes to shit, which is currently heading in that direction, as a CoC like that shook up and divided the community even more than it already was.</p>
<p><strong>Myth 5. Purges of Linux kernel developers have begun.</strong></p>
<p>Wrong. I don't know who said that, but you must've been looking hard for that or pulled it out of your ass.</p>
<p><strong>Myth 6. Developers are leaving Linux and taking their code with them.</strong></p>
<p>This is the same as "Myth 5". Stay consistent for fuck's sake.</p>
<p><strong>Myth 7. Linus is never coming back!</strong></p>
<p>Assumption. Linus talked about a vacation which we don't know the length of and he doesn't want to do anything with the kernel for a while. I'm sure he'll come back, but state it as an <em>opinion</em>, not a <em>fact</em>.</p>
<br>
<p>Conclusion: fake news. Make up your opinions, don't follow articles blindly.</p>
