Finally an update after Christmas</h1>

<p>Welcome to the new and updated site!</p>
<p>Okay, it's not THAT updated.</p>
<p>It's actually still the same, but with a new background and color scheme.</p>
<p>I think these will be quite the only changes to the general layout (for a long while anyway), because I'm satisfied with where I am right now.</p>
<p>The new color scheme is called blueish-shitfest, the new background is a piece of art that I made while messing around in Photoshop for 2 minutes.</p>
<p>Standalone blog files don't look like ass now, I learned that lb is actually quite fucking terrible at generating HTML. By default that garbage put the footer outside of the body, first world problems, but this ain't it chief.</p>
<p>Also, remember when I made like 3 posts on the Linux CoC thing?</p>
<p>Well. Linux is shit, welcome to 2019. Version 5 is slower than ever and distros keep failing left and right. So if you believe that you were betrayed by your most-liked operating system/kernel, it's time to make a switch. I know I did.</p>
<p>I recommend FreeBSD, it's actually quite a powerful system and does a lot of things similar to Linux, it also has the system base and packages seperated, so you can have a stable system AND up-to-date applications, Debian can suck my left nut.</p>
<p>However, FreeBSD has its balls clamped by its retarded CoC, which got railed on when it was released, but now the Linuxfags can't talk shit. Also, its software/hardware support is lackluster. Software isn't as bad as hardware, but some things are straight up missing or outdated. So, it's your choice.</p>
<p>Also, macOS is a real option, it's the one I chose, it has quite a few standard UNIX elements, but also professional application support that no other UNIX(-like) can match. It technically doesn't have a CoC, like Windows, but the CEO is a fag who stated that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/3/18124416/tim-cook-apple-infowars-white-supremacy-podcasts-platform-adl">Apple products aren't for white supremacists</a>. I guess my opinion on it can be shortened to this - I like the product, but I hate the company.</p>
