<p>It's here... The fucking holidays are in one week and everyone got their hats on. All cities in my country have set up their gigantic Christmas trees and all the songs are getting blasted.</p>
<p>I understand it now (which is why I'm joining this <del>garbage</del> tradition, but I never understood joining it a month prior, like in the end of November. But whatever, I don't care.</p>
<p>I positioned myself away from development for the past few weeks and especially from working on this website, I feel like this site's really reached its peak and I can't really change much significant before fucking it up.</p>
<p>Which is kinda sad for me as the changes for the site for such an important (at least for me) season are minimal.</p>
<p>Anyway, enjoy the Alex Jones (support free speech) and a true boomer joke.</p>
