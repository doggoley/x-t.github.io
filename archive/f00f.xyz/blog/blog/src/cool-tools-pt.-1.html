<p>Sometimes I just make tools to make my doodly-doos around the computer a little easier.</p>
<p>Since I think these are too small to have their own git repository or something, I thought I'd share these in my blog.</p>
<p>However many I'll write/release, they'll be "licensed" under CC0. Practically public domain, and if your state/country doesn't have public domain - it'll still act like it.</p>
<p>The first in the series is a small thing I made to learn awk. It counts your music by formats.</p>
<p>FLAC sound molesters can flex their RAID arrays with this.</p>
<p>Here's the source code:</p>
<pre>
#!/bin/bash

find ./ | awk '

BEGIN {
    AllMusic=0
    Flacs=0
    MPThrees=0
    MFourAs=0
    WAVs=0
}

/flac$/ {
    AllMusic++
    Flacs++
}

/mp3$/ {
    AllMusic++
    MPThrees++
}

/m4a$/ {
    AllMusic++
    MFourAs++
}

/wav$/ {
    AllMusic++
    WAVs++
}

END {
    print "Total music:", AllMusic
    print "FLACs:", Flacs
    print "MP3s:", MPThrees
    print "M4As:", MFourAs
    print "WAVs:", WAVs
}
'
</pre>
<p>Of course there are some issues with this, like not supporting every music format in existance. But you can easily edit it, if you would like to do that.</p>
<p>If you're wondering what my music collection looks like, well...</p>
<pre>
~/Music&gt; CountMusic
Total music: 560
FLACs: 367
MP3s: 138
M4As: 54
WAVs: 1
~/Music&gt; 
</pre>
<p>I'll leave it there.</p>
