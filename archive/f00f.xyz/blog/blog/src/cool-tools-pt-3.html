<p>This has definitely been done before (won't check), but I decided to hack another one.</p>
<p>Wanna show what song you're listening to in cmus as a status for pidgin/purple and conky? Well, if you are one of the three people, this thing is for you.</p>
<p>First, the script that shows the current track in a %SONG% - %ARTIST% format. (Referred to as CmusCurrent)</p>
<pre>
#!/bin/bash
cmus-remote -Q | awk '/tag title / { $1=""; $2=""; print } /tag artist / { $1=""; $2=""; print }' | tac | sed ':a;N;$!ba;s/&bsol;n/ /g; s/^&bsol; &bsol; //; s/&bsol; &bsol; &bsol; /&bsol; -&bsol; /'
</pre>
<p>Next, the script that sets the status/outputs the song (Referred to as PurpleCmus)</p>
<pre>
#!/bin/bash
if [[ `cmus-remote -Q | grep status` == "status playing" ]]; then 
purple-remote "setstatus?status=available&amp;message=`CmusCurrent`"
CmusCurrent
fi
</pre>
<p>And lastly, the line in your conky.conf</p>
<pre>
${execi 2 /%PATH_TO%/PurpleCmus}
</pre>
<p>That's about it. Now you can shove in your music taste to anyone that has you added as a buddy on pidgin.</p>
