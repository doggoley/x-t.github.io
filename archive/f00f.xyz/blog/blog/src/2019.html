<p>2018 is gone!</p>
<p>It was a pretty nice year afterall, at least for me personally.</p>
<p>Some dumb shit went down at the second half of it, but overall it wasn't that bad.</p>
<p>I learned quite a lot, in programming and in general. I feel way more confident than before, if you wonder how bad I was, just look in the archive... shit haunts me every nightmare.</p>
<p>Anyway, 2019 will be the last year of this decade, let's hope it won't close horribly.</p>
<p>I don't have any plans or New Year's resolutions. In fact, I don't plan my life ahead the 3 minute mark. There is no point, live in the present, not the future.</p>
