<p>Yeah, I set up a blog.</p>
<p>No particular reason, I just thought that I'd have one.</p>
<p>This runs on lb, a tool made by all-mighty Luke Smith. Tumblr can lick my left nut.</p>
<p>I'm not a blog guy by any means, so expect absolutely no new blog posts.</p>
<p>Maybe they will be memes at best, either way, it's fun setting up shit like this, which is why I do it, even though I may end up never using it.</p>
