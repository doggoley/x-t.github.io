<h1>Hello, Hackintosh.</h1>
<small>[<a href='../2019.html#hello-hackintosh'>link</a>&mdash;<a href='hello-hackintosh.html'>standalone</a>]</small>
<p>As the title suggests, I did it.</p>
<p>I realized that I actually liked macOS a lot more than I thought. I used to shit on it for a whole while, but I've never given it a fair chance.</p>
<p>I finally crossed out of the test period and put it on my main SSD, which I find pretty satisfying.</p>
<p>I used to put things like this in the about page, however I feel like that page should stay about the subject of the page, me, while the blog should be about what I think about/what I am doing.</p>
<p>I used to switch OSes so often I just needed to keep updating that part of the page. I don't wanna do that anymore.</p>
<p>This little OS switch also made me switch to Ethernet, which I can now announce as the superior alternative to Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>Anyway, the page is hitting 100 commits from the Github migration, which is actually quite a lot, but considering how I used to spam about 20 commits per day just to change one CSS variable, I'm not that surprised.</p>
<p>What's in the new update?</p>
<ul>
	<li>No more JS. It was used for a shitty easter egg anyway, and I can't even reproduce it on macOS.</li>
	<li>No more fontawesome. It wasn't used much, the CSS file is like several megabytes, it's fucking awful, I don't wanna use it!</li>
	<li>Unified navbar for both mobile and desktop. I know this one is a bit of a stretch, but I feel like the mobile version of my site was always missing out and kept using the shittier older navbar which uses icons that barely mean anything. A newspaper? What is that even supposed to mean?! You'd have to click on the icon to figure out what it meant. Bad design. I hate sites that do this, I am glad to change my ways from that.</li>
	<li>Debloated some internal structure. Webpages are smaller now, without the same AIDS legacy code.</li>
</ul>
<p>And what is that for you? Saved bandwidth. That's about it. Yeah, small shit, but fuck developers that make sites filled with megabytes of JS frameworks, it's ass.</p>
<p>I feel like the blog has become a changelog for this site, which isn't ideal. Let's talk about my other projects!</p>
<h2>ded.</h2>
<p>Pretty much this. I abandonded everything else other than my site. Why? I just didn't feel like continuing everything else. It may be due to the lack of feedback I receive on them, which is honestly my fault, I don't advertise my shit at all, I just make it for people to find, and people aren't really looking... I would like to work on something new, however I don't have any ideas popping up in my head. Sad!</p>
<p>This entire idea drought just fills that void in my time with stuff that just isn't productive at all, like Minecraft, or YouTube videos. Ever sadder!</p>
<p>Okay, changelogs aren't really going to work. Let's try talking about things in my life.</p>
<p>Well, as my about page used to state, I don't really do anything in my life. It's kinda empty, and whatever I do I'll share with my friends, not just type it out in a blog. I don't really care about Yandex and Bing reading my life stories.</p>
<p>So, I stated that I liked politics, how about a political blog, you know, the one Stallman has.</p>
<p>FUCK. NO.</p>
<p>I talked about politics on this site enough, if I went any farther this would be banned off Github.</p>
<p>So, I feel like this blog has stayed silent for a long while for a reason. There is just nothing to talk about. The last time I actually made insightful commentary on here was the CoC fiasco. So, for a bit, it was a political blog.</p>
<p>I don't know, if maybe by some chance I get some ideas for projects this blog will be resurrected out of obscurity, but as it stands now, it'll be kinda gay.</p>
<p><em>And to end, let's bring back a little mini-series, last seen in October</em></p>
<p>Yes, it's cool tools. This one is small tho. I didn't make this one anyway.</p>
<p>I know there are some folks that patched Mojave onto HD3000 and under iGPUs and have some dogshit graphical glitches, where the colors become muddy and sometimes unreadable.</p>
<p>Well, somebody made a tool for you. <a href="https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/335569-mojave-light-mode-hybrid-transparency-patch-working-with-proof-pictures/">Download it and use it.</a> This thing fixed up my hackintosh and I can't be any happier with it.</p>
<p>This blog post was sponsored by - <a href="https://swinsian.com/">Swinsian</a>: The best music player for macOS. Okay, not sponsored, I just use it, it's really good. I feel sad that it's not that popular. Try it. Also, fuck cmus.</p>
