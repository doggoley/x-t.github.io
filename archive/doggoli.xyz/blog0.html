	<div class="textdiv">

	<p> I came back from Skouras camp yesterday. All in all it was a life changing experience to be honest, i dont think i have ever met so many cool people, and i think i have been this happy for the first time in a while...<p>

	<p>Its nice to break the routine a little, go out and do something you would never do in general, you know, experiment. Im glad i decided to take the plunge and try it out, because in doing so i have met people i would have never gotten to know, and for the first time in my social life i was laughing with someone instead of being laughed at... Fuck, ive never taken a selfie in my entire life before and i came to this camp and i somehow came back with 20 of them. I did't believe anyone would take a picture with me let alone ask me to be in one with them. Needless to say its given me a big moral and self-confidence boost.. My insecurity has dropped, but not completely as i still fell extremely uncomfortable with myself and my body around others... Nevertheless, its a step in the right direction.</p>

	<p>Its gonna be hard to break the habits i made during my 10 day vacation, and i honestly have no idea why i am sad that i'm not waking up in that shitty bunk bed, in a room packed full with 12 people in the middle of a camp that has no connection with the outside world. It's weird. I miss it a lot...</p>
