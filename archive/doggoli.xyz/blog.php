	<p>I remember when i was a kid that in the house we always had a soap with a fish on it, later on when the soap would be empty i would fill it up and pretend i had a little fish in an aquarium...I always begged my parents to get me a fish and i promised that i would take care of it, but i guess they either didnt trust me (neither would i back then tbh) or they just really thought that 12euro was expensive because they always used the excuse that its too expensive and that they dont want to blow a lot of money on a stupid fish i can't even interact with...<p>

	<p>When returning from Skouras i brought back home 15eur, which i was planning on spending on a new laptop battery, however i realized that i really don't need or want that, so i decided to make my childhood wish come true.. The next morning i went to the pet store and bought a small aquarium, a filter, pump, some fake grass, and a castle. All in all that cost me 10euro... When i came home i arranged everything to my liking, powered everything on and left it to run for 24 hours, as suggested by the pet store (the water needs to be fully filtered so that the fish can safely inhabit it). </p>

	<p>When i was at the pet store getting the aquarium i saw a fish that i instantly wanted, a little dark blue and red fighting fish (i later learned that it is called a Siamese Fighting Fish). From the moment i saw him i knew i had to have him... So this morning i went out, picked him, and now he's all mine. His name is QWERTY (yes, like the fish from Mr. Robot) and he isn't very active (kinda like me), i really love him...</p>
