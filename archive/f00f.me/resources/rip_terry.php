    <h1>RIP Terry A. Davis</h1>
    <p>He was a great programmer and a great thinker.</p>
    <p>He suffered from schizophrenia, but that didn't make him any less important.</p>
    <p>Although not popular at first, the man who was once medicated and inhibited</p>
    <p>was a loving man that brought us all education and entertainment.</p>
    <p>From talking through an oracle, now he may talk to God directly.</p>
