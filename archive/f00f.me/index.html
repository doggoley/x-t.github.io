        <p>Hosting this shit isn't free. And, well, I'm broke. This means I need to sacrifice something, and this</p>
        <p>seems to be the most logical choice. It was fun administrating this server, and it definitely</p>
        <p>gave me a lot more knowledge about servers/websites.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As for the sacrifice, I'm moving to GitHub pages and I'm saying goodbye to my domain, f00f.me.</p>
        <p>It's a little sad, but it is what I have to do.</p>
        <br>
        <p>You can find my new site <a href="https://x-t.github.io">here</a>. There are a few new blog posts there, and it's completely</p>
        <p>open source/free as in freedom, and you can find the source code <a href="https://github.com/x-t/x-t.github.io">here</a></p>
        <br>
        <p>But in another way, I'm glad, I will now be able to focus on the site's content instead of keeping it alive.</p>
        <p>Also, no more PHP, yay!</p>
