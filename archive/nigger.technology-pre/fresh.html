	<h1>fun facts about gays</h1>
	<p>An estimated 632,300 gay and bisexual men had HIV at the end of 2015, representing 56% of everyone with HIV.</p>
	<p>1 in 6 gay and bisexual men with HIV are unaware they have it.</p>
	<p>Gay teens in U.S. schools are often subjected to such intense bullying that theyâ€™re unable to receive an adequate education.</p>
	<p>One survey revealed that more than one-third of gay respondents had missed an entire day of school in the past month because they felt unsafe there.</p>
	<p>LGBT youth feel they have nowhere to turn.</p>
	<p> Gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender youth are more than twice as likely to experiment with drugs and alcohol.</p>
	<p>The risk of self-harm among LGBT youth is 2,5 times more likely.</p>
	<h2>TL;DR: DON'T BE GAY, YOU'RE GONNA GET BULLIED, YOU'RE GONNA FEEL SHIT, AND YOU'RE GONNA KILL YOURSELF WITH DRUGS AND ALCOHOL.</h2>
