0. Prelude

I am a student, that used to (and still kind of) do programming as a hobby.
I am also just a man that likes technology, low-level and high-level.
So, what experience do I have that gives me a deserved opinion?
	- I've used macOS for over a year, as a hackintosh and on Apple hardware (High Sierra-Catalina)
	- I've used Windows as a daily driver for over 10 years, I still fix some machines running it and I use it myself on occasion, on a different machine or on a VM. Versions 98 through 10.
	- I've used Android for over 5 years, since 2.3 up to 9.
	- I've used Linux as my main from 2015-2019, I still administrate servers that run Linux.
	- I've been interested in non-mainstream OS projects like FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Haiku and have been evaluating them on their usability. I know my alternatives.

	Hardware wise,

	- I've used an AMD Thunderbird 1600XP desktop from 2004/2005-2012 (Windows 98/XP)
	- I've used a Toshiba Sattelite laptop from 2012-2015 (Windows 7/10)
	- I've used a Packard Bell laptop from 2015-2017 (Linux (mainly Arch, Debian)/FreeBSD)
	- I've used a ThinkPad X200 from 2017-2018 (Linux (mainly Debian))
	- I've used a ThinkPad X230 for a month in 2018 until refuding it (Linux (primarily Debian))
	- I've used a ThinkPad X220 from 2018-2020 (Linux (Debian, Ubuntu), Windows 7/10, macOS Lion/High Sierra/Mojave/Catalina)
	- I own a ThinkPad R40, used it for a few old Windows games (Windows 2000)
	- I've used a MacBook Pro 13-inch, Late 2013 since 2020/03/20 (macOS Catalina)

	Mobile space,

	- I've used old Nokia phones since God knows from when up to when... (SymbianOS)
	- I've used a Samsung C3300 and a GT-S5230 from like 2010 up to... I'll put my money on 2013  (Samsung's Java OS)
	- I've used an HTC Desire HD from 2013 to idk, maybe 2014? (Android 2.3)
	- I've used a Samsung Galaxy Trend Lite for a few months until I had to throw it away (Android 4.1.2)
	- I've used a Samsung Galaxy S2 for a few years (Android 4.1.2-7)
	- I've used a Samsung Galaxy S4 for another few years (Android 5-8)
	- I've used a Samsung Galaxy S6 for my last Android phone (Android 8-9)
	- I've used an iPhone 7, since 2019/11/09 (iOS 13)
	- I've used an iPhone SE for one weekend (iOS 13)

If you have more experience and think otherwise, feel free to top over me. I am just a hobbyist. But I think I have a pretty long running experience from different platforms.

1. Software

1.1. macOS

Out of pretty much all the platforms I have tried, including the completely alternative ones, I think macOS just has the most polish than anything else. There is absolutely no system like macOS, the amount of detail, Apple's complete micromanagement of every tiny thing. It absolutely shows, espcially with the communication of hardware and software, but I'll talk about that later. Linux and Windows users tried to do their best to try and replicate the macOS look and feel, but absolutely never got it right. There is a market for these, considering how popular macOS look-alike docks and themes are on Linux and Windows.
The thing is, however well you might make the theme look, there is still some functionality that is pretty much only available on macOS. Well, knockoffs of that are available everywhere, but the real deal is only here.
For example, Spotlight.
Spotlight has a few knockoffs - like Windows Search, dmenu or rofi. The thing is, however customizable dmenu or rofi are, they won't do the same stuff as Spotlight can, and sure as shit not all in the same window. You'd need multiple keybinds to launch applications, search files, do calculations, look up definitions all in the same window. And on Windows Search, lmao, don't even talk about it. Every Windows user knows it's utter garbage at even just finding applications, let alone files.
macOS also has an UNIX base, which means that almost everything that runs on Linux, has a port for macOS. You can use MacPorts or brew to download that stuff. Works just as any other package manager, and I haven't experienced any packages breaking, although, I have to admit, I do use it a lot less. There is no centralized package manager, which means most applications come in their own .apps that update themselves. Which although some consider literally to be malware, I believe is a good thing, as it completely gets rid of the failure point that the package manager usually is. apt always loved to fail on me and started uninstalling random stuff for updates or just installation of new packages. Something like that never happens on Windows or Mac, because it's impossible.
However because it has an UNIX base, you can freely do programming on it, and don't be absolutely punished for it, like you would be on Windows. Compilers are up-to-date and working, whatever I was doing development/sysadmin-related on Linux, I easily switched over to macOS. I stopped messing with the terminal as much, because Finder was actually good, unlike Dolphin or Nautilus. Where are my icons in the file picker, Linux, where were they 12 years ago, where are they now?
Not only that, the application support is absolutely stellar. You get everything from Linux, everything that's multi-platform and the entire suite of professional applications, like Adobe, with Apple's lineup, like Logic, FCPX, Xcode, etc. Only Windows can compete with this, and most of Windows-only stuff is games and boomer software. I don't care for neither, so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
If I had to come up with some negative things about macOS, I'd probably say these
- New releases are buggy. You have to wait a month or so, up to the 10.XX.2 or 10.XX.3 release if possible to iron out the bugs. If you're brave, you can even run the beta versions, but don't hold your breath on those.
- macOS is absolutely not modular. If you want that, you can go to Linux. It's not that macOS isn't customizable, that's different, you can customize the hell out of macOS, but you will have to do it completely differently, by installing software on top of your existing fully functional macOS install. It's just that you will not be able to replace parts of your install. You may end up with a window manager on top of a DE on top of a window manager. For Linux users, myself included, that seems pretty weird, but it is a price to pay if you actually care to customize it, which I don't, and want to have all the benefits of macOS.
- Sometimes Apple just makes bold decisions for no real explainable reason. The latest example is Catalina's removal of 32-bit application support. I get why they did it, 64-bit is absolutely the present and applications should've switched to it since Lion, and to encourage people to do it for the final time by cutting off their stuff immediately, but the fact is, some developers just don't bother to update the stuff. Maybe it's a cross-platform game which was written for 32-bit Windows to allow both 32-bit and 64-bit CPUs play it, but a 64-bit port to macOS was impossible, so they just made it 32-bit. Worse performance, but still works. This is how almost all of Steam games are now incompatible on Catalina. And some developers are just absolutely lazy, this is especially true for enterprise-level developers, which will shit out absolutely anything as long as it "works", meaning a lot of business applications people used for work no longer work. It's a good slap on the wrist for developers, but it's an unfortunate worse situation for users. Personally, I didn't have that many games to begin with and I never had 32-bit applications, so I upgraded just fine.
- Locked down to Apple hardware. I have used a hackintosh for a year, it is a pain in the ass. To maintain and to use. You're not guaranteed perfect compatibility. Something is very likely to break, for me, on the X220 a lot of things were broken, including the GPU which displayed graphics glitches, the microphone which was at full volume and ear raped everyone that had to listen to it, random freezing and system crashes, and the absolute joke of stability, where every update would increase my BPM and give me a heart attack because Clover may not be updated and this update isn't going to boot anymore.

1.2. iOS

Oh man, I expected to get that same macOS experience, that attention to detail, that feeling when everything's just put right into place, on mobile, and I did get it. Although it did take some sacrifice.
I don't know where to begin with the thing, I know iOS used to be extremely locked down and worlds apart from Android, but switching from Android 9 to iOS 13 was absolutely easy. All the applications I used to use had equivalents and/or just had official versions to begin with, the keyboard was extremely similar, especially with "Swipe to type" from iOS 13.
iOS just makes so much more sense than Android most of the time, it has a lot more privacy and security features, the app store actually works, apps crash a whole lot less, and I absolutely don't have to void my warranty to make the phone usable, where I'd have to deal with TouchJizz on Samsungs (and I did, until I completely gave up).
I generally don't think that there's that much difference between Android and iOS, especially in the modern era. It's just that I was much more annoyed by the entire Android philosophy of "this is 10 year old Java code, it only works whenever the fuck it wants to". It's much easier syncing an iOS device than having to manage it manually on an Android. It's much easier to develop for an iOS device, plug it in and Xcode recognizes it immediately, instead of having enable the fucking ADB bridge from developer settings and then trying to break hell with that, with Android Studio, which is slower than a snail on weed.
You can also jailbreak an iOS device, which is an equivalent, although not really, of rooting on Android. Jailbreaking allows you to unlock the OS and circumvent the negatives that I'll mention later on. Thing is it's highly specific on the device and iOS version on your eligability of jailbreak and the persistance of it. For example, the iPhone 7 has checkra1n, which currently doesn't work on 13.4 and requires you to tether it to a Mac to jailbreak it again after every reboot, thankfully, I haven't experienced a whole lot of random reboots on iOS *cough* unlike on Android *cough*. And on an iPhone Xs you'd have to use unc0ver, which will work on your device without tether, although you'll have to launch the app every reboot, and currently I don't know its compatibility with iOS versions.
What I find the funniest about jailbreaking is the fact that it's actually extremely safe on your warranty. Apple technicians most of the time don't even notice Cydia just floating around on the homepages. If they do, you can easily remove the jailbreak by rebooting your phone or straight up restoring a stock iOS. That stuff is never getting detected, unlike let's say KNOX on Samsung phones which will be tripped if you root it or flash anything and your warranty is absolutely gone for life, no amount of stock ROM installs will trip it back.
Also, the integration between iOS and macOS is absolutely stellar. Not only can you sync the thing in iTunes/Finder with your music and everything else, you also get a whole lot other goodies. Such as iCloud syncing all your photos, calendar events, reminders, notes between devices, AirDrop files and links between devices, Handoff between a computer and phone, receive and send messages on the fly through your Mac and iPhone.
Also not to mention how pretty fucking amazing iMessage is. I don't get to use it that much, but when I do, it's really good. The quick ability to send photos to someone via a phone number instead of having to go through Messenger or something is really nice. They also work in place of the regular SMS stuff, which means that a person will sure as hell receive it if they don't just leave their phone dead forever. This and AirDrop are the two signature iPhone tricks, it's what makes people stay, Google tried, but it was absolutely hopeless trying to match it.
It's not that hard thinking of negatives about iOS, but personally I always saw it as a trade. For these, you get a shitload better stability and usability.
- Completely not customizable. You need a jailbreak to install customizations to the interface.
- You cannot sideload applications. Not normally anyway. You have to use something like AppValley, which sometimes just doesn't have any app available to install. Once the certificate is revoked, you'll have to reinstall the app with a different certificate. With a jailbreak, you can install apps without any limits. Apple has been making an active war with sideloaded apps, minimizing developer certificate usable time from 90 days to 7, taking down leaked Apple IDs of Chinese corporations that are used to sign all apps. Why? That seems like such an asshole move. I get it, security, but Android allows it, and their security backbone is a shitload worse than iOS to begin with. To be fair, I only care about Spotify, if I wasn't poor and had ‚Ç¨7 per month to spare, I'd sure as hell stop caring about this 100%.
- File management is completely impossible, because of how everything is structured. Applications have their own sandboxes with their files, the only real files you manage are in iCloud. I know some people hate that, but I couldn't care less, you don't really lose the file management of Android, which mind you, is barely of any use, and you seriously only download a file manager when you root your phone.

1.3. Misc

Yeah, Apple develops more software. Almost all of it is only available on macOS and iOS. I'll rapid fire through some Apple software and give my opinion.
- iTunes/Music: best music player I've probably used, ever. I can only compare it with Clementine, which only looks good on Linux. Foobar2000 was also pretty great, but that default look is borderline ugly, must put a theme on it and themes don't work through Wine. Only gripe is that it doesn't play FLACs, you have to convert them, which with XLD, it's pretty easy.
- Safari: it's an okay browser. Faster than Chrome in benchmarks, I'm pretty sure it will lend you better battery life if you use it instead of Chrome or Firefox. Horrible extension support, barely anything there. Ka-block! does only like half that uBlock does, HTTPS Everywhere is not available. I don't really like using it that much, but it's not that bad.
- Finder: best file manager that I've used. Has a fuckton of features, doesn't bug out that much, has icons in the file picker, the design makes sense and looks good. Highly recommend you turn on the path bar and the status bar though, path bar especially, without it, you can get lost easily.
- Mail: it's an okay mail client. Nothing too special, I'm pretty sure people that used Thunderbird won't really want to switch, it's a lot simpler than that.
- Feedback Assistant: haha please respond
- Final Cut Pro X: I don't edit video anymore, but I tried it with a few joke clips and it was nice to use and gave me the impression of "I know nothing about this" which gives me a lot of hope, as that means there is a lot of opportunity.
- Terminal: I know a lot of people that actually use the terminal on macOS tend to install iTerm2, but I don't really see why, this one rocks pretty damn well, it sure as hell is more powerful than 90% of the stuff that comes preloaded in most Linux distros. iTerm2 just seems so overkill.
- AppleScript: what the fu-
- iLife: nice? I guess, I didn't actually use it at all on Lion lol.
- iWork: really nice. I like using it, although the export to Word functionality is a little hit-or-miss, I'll touch up the docx formatting in the online version of Word afterwards. But something like Keynote is exceptional. Pages is my favorite document editor, and that's just the way it'll be, fuck ribbons.

2. Hardware

2.1. iPhone

It's pretty boring. Whatever Apple makes, which sometimes isn't even that amazing, other companies will just go ahead and copy. I use an iPhone 7, which is inherently a dated design with thick bezels, the form factor is super slippery somehow, it can just slide out of my pocket sometimes. The notched phones just seem to get bigger every year for no reason. The SE is my favorite form factor, I wish Apple had actually the balls to make something amazing in the SE body, instead of releasing the 5S again with 6S hardware.
My iPhone came with a hardware fault OOTB, a broken fingerprint sensor. It's weird to have something broken right out of the box, but I took it in for warranty, got it serviced in like a week, in the meantime I got an iPhone SE. Apple service, while under warranty, is absolutely amazing.
The stability of using an iPhone has been absolutely amazing for me. It has so little issues compared with Android, including, but not limited to random reboots, service failure, random Wi-Fi disconnection and slowdown over time with updates.
If you're speaking of cool hardware features, I'll praise the mute switch - once you get used to it, the Android solution feels antiquated. I'll also praise the screens on these things, they are seriously good for not even being OLED, and I come from an OLED display, this also means that these displays will last a lot longer than OLEDs, because OLEDs have a tendency to have horrible burn-in.
If I had to come up with some negatives, I'll go with these
- The fingerprint sensor is still hit or miss. It's not broken, yeah, but it's still glass, which seems to work a lot worse.
- Slippery as all hell. It's not even glass on the back, but the rounded off corners do feel great in the hand, but are the slipperiest shit imaginable. No, I will not wear a case, I just have a screen protector.
- Apple can be very cheap sometimes. The iPhone 6 was a complete disaster. The iPhone XR doesn't even have 720p resolution, I know retina means ppi, not resolution in general, and I hate Android manufacturers that shove in 1440p displays as that is only fucking good, but that's still laughably low. The iPhone 11 suffers from scratchgate or some shit. Apple also slowed down phones without telling you, to save your battery's longevity.

2.2. Mac

Oh man... This one's a very weird one.
The only real Mac I own is the MacBook Pro Late 2013 13-inch, and I guess I'll go ahead and try to review Apple's lineup from this perspective.
I have always wanted a Mac from ever since I was a little kid. It actually meant quite a lot to me. You could say, I used to be an Apple fanboy of some sort. Apple's design decisions looked sexy as all fucking hell, and they absolutely killed it with their designs, with even 10+ year old designs looking way better than current Windows laptop designs, which were even more insane for the stuff that was released back then. The designs age well and the specs on the laptops are actually decent.
I have a last-generation MacBook Pro, that is, it's one generation (or two if you count the 16-inch MBP a new generation) before the 2016 update. And it may be the most reliable generation ever. From the previous ones (2006, 2011) which had extreme failure rates for GPUs, to the 2016-2019 ones with extreme rates of failing keyboards and soldered in SSDs. The Late-2013/Mid-2014 are absolute reliability kings, with good design and a Rossmann approval stamp. The 2015 one is dodgy, they're known a bit for failing SATA cables (lmfao), bad SSDs, and overheating due to Apple deciding to no longer spin the fan at low RPM.
The old models are pretty good to find pretty cheap, I picked up mine for ‚Ç¨350, which is a really good deal in general, but especially in Eastern Europe, considering this model was probably $1500 new (bought in early 2014), that's a nice drop. Granted, it is 7 years old, but it is arguably better than even the new MacBooks, considering it has ports, the same display, and specs that are pretty damn comparable because Intel hasn't released anything good since Sandy Bridge.
The keyboards on this older generation are really amazing. I wrote pretty much the entirety of this updated review on one, and they are actually really comfortable to type on. I also like chiclet keys because I tend to be faster and more accurate on them. I also like the fact that the function keys were repurposed into something useful, instead of letting it be the wild west and letting some applications do some things. I think the keyboard layout is best described as "a chromebook but actually useful", because chromebooks can't run macOS, but this keyboard is actually specifically made for macOS, I don't miss function keys, because you don't use them in macOS, I don't miss the separate delete key, because not all applications even support it, and I still never ended up using it. I don't miss home/end keys because not all editors support them, and I got used to that. I don't miss the pgup/pgdown keys because... they were never necesarry. I don't miss the pause/printscr/scrolllock keys because I hit them twice by year, accidentally. I have done some programming on this keyboard, these things don't matter.
The display... The first time I opened up the MBP and powered it on, my immediate reaction was "holy shit, did I actually buy that?". I have grown up in a household where 1280x800 and 1366x768 were the highest resolutions on monitors. Strictly Windows laptop stuff, I guess. I went from the Toshiba's 1366x768 IPS bleeding, although not that bad, display to the Packard Bell's 1366x768 one, it was almost the same, although it ended up developing dead pixels, which was a pain to use, but I got used to it... I got used to dead pixels. I am a flexible man. After the hard drive died in that pile of ass I immediately decided to buy a new computer. New meaning old, a Thinkpad X200. That had a 1280x800 TFT display... bad. It was pretty yellowed, not that bad as some others, but it was noticeably yellow after using some other laptops. It was also very dim. Next I ended up with an X230 which somehow had a 1366x768 IPS display, the viewing angles were good, but the backlight bleed was horrible, the ghosting was attorcious, I had to return the thing, which meant - I upgraded to a TN 1366x768 X220 panel. Yeah, I say upgrade, because although the color was worse and the viewing angles were worse too, it was still a lot nicer to use than the X230. And now, I had to experience a proper IPS Apple-quality panel at 2560x1600 resolution... That is a fucking insane experience, you can seriously underestimate just how important the display is on a laptop, it's the primary thing you look at, and how it looks is super important to the overall experience. You seriously have to experience it for yourself in order to understand just how amazing this stuff is. You can read fineprint, letters look sharper than printed paper, individual pixels are absolutely not visible.
The trackpad is absolutely the best ever. The tracking is exceptional, the palm detection doesn't disappoint, the glass surface just feels so nice and multi-touch gestures work so well. Compared to the trackpoint which made my index finger go so stiff I couldn't move it after a few hours of use, this is soooo much easier to use. Go to an Apple store and try it, these trackpads are better than anything else on the market, fact.
The relationship of hardware and software is absolutely what makes the Mac so amazing. The hardware may not be the best thing in the world, but the optimizations Apple does is amazing, on the iPhone and on the Mac. Still, the relationship is much more than optimization, the special EFI apple uses is fast as fuck and handy with the "internet recovery" shit, the scaling of the insanely high resolution display is absolutely the best compared to any other operating system.
The downsides I guess I have already talked about, but I may touch upon more here
- Some designs are very unreliable, please check Rossmann out before actually buying the device, think if it'll be reliable enough for you.
- Lack of ports on the 2013-2015. I personally don't think there's that much to lack, there are plenty of ports, however if you require Ethernet, maybe you'll have a problem. Note though, these laptops have STELLAR Wi-Fi connectivity.
- Lack of ports on the 2016-now. Yeah... You'll need dongles for that stuff.
- Soldered in shit. In my laptop, the RAM is soldered, on the 2016 model, the SSD is soldered too.
- Difficult to service. To open these things you need several screwdrivers, including Apple's own proprietary Pentalobe screwdrivers, which is a pain in the ass. These are definitely hardly serviceable, only do it if you actually know what you're doing. If you want a serviceable MacBook, you should get older models, the 2012 one is pretty nice with the ability to change the RAM and SSD, but you will need some screwdrivers. The old plastic models are even more modular with easily swappable topcases and stuff.
P.S. Viewing angles don't matter too much, however the vertical viewing angle is very important on a laptop, as that will indicate how much trouble you'll have with just general use, i.e. how much you'll have to adjust to see stuff clearly. I'm still amazed at the viewing angles on my display, as I have a habit of trying to put the screen at an angle that's straight to my eyes, but the colors no longer change, which is very weird.

3. Ecosystem

Well, I have an iPhone and a Mac, how does that work?
It works really nicely! I'll name features of the things I get and give a review of each feature.
Yes, I have talked about some of these before.

- Syncining music: useful, as Finder already takes care of the compression rates so I don't have to convert my FLACs to MP3 and then send them off manually, which I did to my Android phone.
- Xcode: it's interesting developing for iOS, a lot easier to get than Android development lol.
- iMessage: I've used it, it feels nice using a real keyboard to send text messages to someone. I also get notifications on my desktop, which is also useful if my phone is somewhere else in the house.
- iCloud: I utilize almost all of it. I use the Photos syncing, I use the Notes app, I use the Reminders app, I use the Calendar app. They are all amazing, the Photos one especially, I can take a photo and immediately send it through to someone via my laptop.
- Handoff: I generally didn't use it that much.
- Airdrop: very useful, to drop files. Although I have used the Photos app which will mostly handle most of the cases you might want to instantly share files with a computer/phone.

4. Conclusion

Uhh... yeah. I enjoy using these products, I love the integration between them all. I love the features I gained and I think that I will not be switching off Apple any time soon. I used to hate Apple so much, yet here I am, almost sucking off their cock at this point.
I just personally think what they do is an exceptional job at making computers. While the iPhone may be kinda underwhelming, I personally believe it only to be so because I always looked at phones more like tools and computers just meant so much more to me. And the magical stuff Apple does with hardware and software is just absolutely amazing.
I believe that many people that hate the absolute shit out of Apple are just people that haven't used the stuff for themselves. I know I used to be one. I haven't used anything Apple made and I hated soooo much of it. I hated Apple, Apple products, Apple software and Apple users. How can you be so ignorant that you use such shit software, right? It's not that I'm ignorant because I haven't used it ever myself, right?...
Apple's mission statement from the Steve Jobs era is still staying the same, developing exceptional products. And I believe that they are still doing it. While yes, some of the stuff they do can be controversial, I believe it's for the better sometimes. All ports are gone, well, at least they're now fast as fuck. The CD drive is gone, well, they were horrible anyways. Magsafe is gone... why? no, what the fuck, why??? 32 bit support is gone, only fast applications are allowed. You can choose to buy new products and use new software and stay on the edge of Apple's "innovation", or lay back and relax. Most software works from OS X 10.9 or 10.10, you'll be fine.
I also do not believe Apple products suffer from planned obsolescence, my 7 year old MacBook runs the latest version of macOS, and much older MacBooks can run the latest versions of macOS with patches. The hardware longevity is actually quite good, considering on the model. The iPhone 5S got updates for 6 years. You could only make the case for planned obsolescence on iPhones for the Apple slowing down phones because of battery conservation, but even still, you can go under warranty and replace it.
Also, I'd like to give them an applause for the warranty service. Quick as fuck, got a replacement phone while I had to wait and the guys down at the store were nice. Definitely not something I've seen with repair on Android phones.
Summed up, my opinion about Apple is really positive. I like their stuff, I think it's good. It fits me pretty damn well, as I loved switching to macOS on the X220 and I loved switching from a Thinkpad to a MacBook üôÉ
