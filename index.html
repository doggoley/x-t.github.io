	own build system :) Also, the CSS is integrated in the page,
	to constrain myself to one page only.

	Two weeks after the one year anniversary of his death, this mesage
	was displayed on a seperate landing page.

		<h1>RIP Terry A. Davis</h1>
		<p>August 11th marks the 1 year of his passing.</p>
		<p>It is a shame such a man had to die, he was an idol to me. I feel like many people can learn a lot from him. His demise, his work.</p>
		<p>It takes a lot of dedication, patience and intellect to create a fully fledged OS single handedly over 10 years.</p>
		<p>And although I may have 1/20th of these, he still made me strive for these values.</p>
		<p>Light a candle in his honor.</p>
		<p>I am also reopening a small archive of Terry's stuff I have collected. <a href="terry/index.html">Check it here.</a></p>

	<h2 class="c">About</h2>
	<p>I'm a 16 y/o high school student from Lithuania. Born on March 2nd, to rant about various things like a 60 year old man.</p>
	<p>While now I barely do anything, I used to be a half-active developer. Sometimes I do fire up a text editor and update my site or work on a project, however those days have become more and more far in-between.</p>
	<p>If you want an honest opinion, you can count on me. I don't like telling lies and I really don't like hugboxing. I also do a hell of a load of banter, which I know some people get offended by.</p>
	<p>I hate the internet, I hate every stupid profile on every centralized social platform. Although I do use them, I don't feel right using them. The best thing about the old internet is the mess that it used to be, with everyone jumping onto GeoCities to make their own site about them. Yes, most of them were terrible, most of them were just 200 gifs stuck in loops that made your eyes bleed. However I strive for character, I strive for humanity. Faceless profiles with a certain layout with you just having to type in your name, your bio and upload a picture tells me nothing about you. It is an utter polar opposite with personal sites.</p>
	<p>My main interests are technology, music and just remembering the good ol' days. I am a big boomer, although I sometimes can try to hide it. I'm a big music man, if I'm not listening to something right now, my mind is already humming something from memory. I don't play any instruments, and I don't really have any favorite genres, the most I listen to is rock and synthwave/electronic.</p>
	<p>A really big idol in my life is Terry A. Davis, which I have an archive with some of his work and photos on <u><a href="terry/gallery.html">here</a></u>.</p>
	<p>I also have a cat, she's quite amazing, and although she bites me, she still brings up my mood, <u><a href="cat/gallery.html">here are some pictures</a></u>.</p>
	<br>
	<h2 class="c">Contact</h2>
	<p>I am on many more platforms, if it's not here, it's very likely I'll never respond.</p>
	<div class="contactList">
		<p><i class="fas fa-at"></i> E-mail: <u><a href="mailto:cmp@airmail.cc">cmp // airmail.cc</a></u></p>
		<p><i class="fab fa-telegram"></i> Telegram: <u><a href="https://t.me/zxyz0">@zxyz0</a></u></p>

	<h2 class="c">Work</h2>
	<p class="list c"><a href="https://github.com/x-t" class="linkWork" title="GitHub"><i class="fab fa-github"></i> x-t</a> <span class="hSpacer"></span>|<span class="hSpacer"></span> <a href="https://gitlab.com/f00f" class="linkWork" title="GitLab"><i class="fab fa-gitlab"></i> f00f</a></p>
	<p>I participated in the making of and keep maintaining <u><a href="https://nigger.technology">nigger.technology</a></u>.</p>
	<p>My most complex project was <u><a href="https://github.com/x-t/okforms">okforms</a></u>.</p>
	<p>The piece of shit that made me the most headaches was <u><a href="https://github.com/x-t/ebin-dos">ebin-dos</a></u>.</p>
	<p>I sometimes try to work on hackintoshing, see my X220 EFI folder <u><a href="https://github.com/x-t/x220-mojave-efi">here</a></u>.</p>
	<p>Since I lost almost all respect for open source advocates and projects, I decided to keep this website closed. If you want, copy it, I won't care.</p>
	<p>I dabbled with high-level and low-level stuff. From full stack development, to front-end development, down to operating systems, although that one I haven't really figured out at all.</p>
