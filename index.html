		<h1>RIP Terry A. Davis</h1>
		<p>August 11th marks the 1 year of his passing.</p>
		<p>It is a shame such a man had to die, he was an idol to me. I feel like many people can learn a lot from him. His demise, his work.</p>
		<p>It takes a lot of dedication, patience and intellect to create a fully fledged OS single handedly over 10 years.</p>
		<p>And although I may have 1/20th of these, he still made me strive for these values.</p>
		<p>Light a candle in his honor.</p>
		<p>I am also reopening a small archive of Terry's stuff I have collected. <a href="terry/index.html">Check it here.</a></p>

	<h2 class="c">About</h2>
	<p>I'm a 17 y/o high school student from Lithuania. Born to rant about various things like a 60 year old man.</p>
	<p>While now I barely do anything, I used to be a half-active developer. Sometimes I do fire up a text editor and update my site or work on a project, however those days have become more and more far in-between.</p>
	<p>I hate the internet, I hate every stupid profile on every centralized social platform. Although I do use them, I don't feel right using them. The best thing about the old internet is the mess that it used to be, with everyone jumping onto GeoCities to make their own site about them. Yes, most of them were terrible, most of them were just 200 gifs stuck in loops that made your eyes bleed. However I strive for character, I strive for humanity. Faceless profiles with a certain layout with you just having to type in your name, your bio and upload a picture tells me nothing about you. It is an utter polar opposite with personal sites.</p>
	<p>My main interests are technology, music and just remembering the good ol' days. I am a big boomer, although I sometimes can try to hide it. I'm a big music man, if I'm not listening to something right now, my mind is already humming something from memory. I don't play any instruments, and I don't really have any favorite genres, the most I listen to is rock and synthwave/electronic.</p>
	<br>
	<h2 class="c">Contact</h2>
	<p>I am on many more platforms, if it's not here, it's very likely I'll never respond.</p>
	<div class="contactList">
		<p><i class="fas fa-at"></i> E-mail: <u><a href="mailto:cmp@airmail.cc">cmp // airmail.cc</a></u> (Preferred)</p>
		<p><i class="fab fa-telegram"></i> Telegram: <u><a href="https://t.me/zxyz0">@zxyz0</a></u> (Please introduce yourself properly)</p>

	</div>
	<p>I participated in the making of and maintained <u><a href="https://nigger.technology">nigger.technology</a></u>. I rewrote it to use Bootstrap. Please note that the site is offensive on purpose, as a satirical insult to actual racists. I leave it here because I more worked on the site internals than the content.</p>
	<p>My most complex project was <u><a href="https://github.com/x-t/okforms">okforms</a></u>. It's a no-bullshit forms/polls creator and viewer, written in pure PHP from scratch.</p>
	<p>The piece of shit that made me the most headaches was <u><a href="https://github.com/x-t/ebin-dos">ebin-dos</a></u>. Mainly a hello world from an x86 bootloader.</p>
	<p>I sometimes try to work on hackintoshing, see my X220 EFI folder <u><a href="https://github.com/x-t/x220-lion-efi">here (Lion)</a></u>, <u><a href="https://github.com/x-t/x220-mojave-efi">here (Mojave)</a></u> or <u><a href="https://github.com/x-t/x220-catalina-efi">here (Catalina, the one I use daily)</a></u>.</p>
	<p>This website's repo itself is private, you can copy its code, I don't care.</p>
	<p>My developement expertise is mostly web-related work. I don't really use back-ends anymore, and just focus on the front-end now.</p>
	<p>Nowadays, if I want to make something I'll just bodge something together using JS, as I cannot be bothered to maintain proper codebases.</p>
	<p>Other than programming, I can do some system administration. I ran a fair share of Linux servers, from a homelab (which I still run to this day), to a VPS to host game servers and websites, as well as <u><a href="https://github.com/x-t/xyzanalytics">analytics (PHP)</a></u> data for me and a friend.</p>
