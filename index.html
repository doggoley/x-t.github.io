	<p>I'm a 16 y/o student from Lithuania.</p>
	<p>Used to be a developer. Although I still didn't <i>completely</i> lose interest.</p>
	<p>I absolutely hate hugboxing. I try to be as honest as possible, which sometimes means even bad things.</p>
	<p>The internet went down the shitter, I made this site as a way to leave a mark in this centralized mess.</p>
	<p>I like messing with technology, sipping boomer monster and remembering the good ol' days.</p>

	<p>Since I lost almost all respect for open source advocates and projects, I decided to keep this website closed. Even if the source code is there, it's unlicensed.</p>
