	Two weeks after the one year anniversary of his death, this mesage
	was displayed on a seperate landing page.

	<div class="ripTerry">
		<h1>RIP Terry A. Davis</h1>
		<p>August 11th marks the 1 year of his passing.</p>
		<p>It is a shame such a man had to die, he was an idol to me. I feel like many people can learn a lot from him. His demise, his work.</p>
		<p>It takes a lot of dedication, patience and intellect to create a fully fledged OS single handedly over 10 years.</p>
		<p>And although I may have 1/20th of these, he still made me strive for these values.</p>
		<p>Light a candle in his honor.</p>
		<p>I am also reopening a small archive of Terry's stuff I have collected. <a href="terry/index.html">Check it here.</a></p>

	<h2 class="c">About</h2>
	<p>I'm a 17 y/o high school student from Lithuania.</p>
	<p>I <em>used to be</em> a developer/sysadmin. Sometimes I do fire up a text editor and update my site or work on a project, however those days have become more and more far in-between.</p>
	<p>I made this website because I thought that it would be fun to maintain a page about myself. It's a lot more revealing than a social media profile, why don't you try it?</p>
	<p>My main interests are technology, music and just livin'. I'm a big music man, if I'm not listening to something right now, my mind is already humming something from memory. I don't play any instruments, and I don't really have any favorite genres.</p>
	<br>
	<h2 class="c">Contact</h2>
	<p>I am on many more platforms, but if it's not here, it's very likely I'll never respond.</p>
	<div class="contactList">
		<p><i class="fas fa-at"></i> E-mail: <u><a href="mailto:cmp@airmail.cc">cmp // airmail.cc</a></u> (Preferred)</p>
		<p><i class="fab fa-telegram"></i> Telegram: <u><a href="https://t.me/zxyz0">@zxyz0</a></u> (Please introduce yourself properly)</p>
	</div>
	<br>
	<h2 class="c">Work</h2>
	<div class="contactList">
		<p><i class="fab fa-github"></i> Github: <u><a href="https://github.com/x-t">x-t</a></u></p>
		<p><i class="fab fa-gitlab"></i> Gitlab: <u><a href="https://gitlab.com/f00f">f00f</a></u> (I don't use it for anything anymore)</p>
	</div>
	<p>I participated in the making of and maintained <u><a href="https://nigger.technology">nigger.technology</a></u>. I rewrote it to use Bootstrap. Please note that the site is offensive on purpose, as a satirical insult to actual racists. I leave it here because I more worked on the site internals than the content. To a much less offensive version of the technology used, please look at my <a href="archive/index.html">archive</a>, where you can find the old version of <a href="archive/f00f.xyz/index.html">f00f.xyz</a>.</p>
	<p>My most complex project was <u><a href="https://github.com/x-t/okforms">okforms</a></u>. It's a no-bullshit forms/polls creator and viewer, written in pure PHP from scratch.</p>
	<p>The piece of shit that made me the most headaches was <u><a href="https://github.com/x-t/ebin-dos">ebin-dos</a></u>. Mainly a hello world from an x86 bootloader.</p>
	<p>I contributed a bit to hackintoshing, see my ThinkPad X220 EFI folder <u><a href="https://github.com/x-t/x220-lion-efi">here (Lion)</a></u>, <u><a href="https://github.com/x-t/x220-mojave-efi">here (Mojave)</a></u> or <u><a href="https://github.com/x-t/x220-catalina-efi">here (Catalina, the one I use daily)</a></u>.</p>
	<p>This website's repo itself is private, you can copy its code from view-source, I don't care.</p>
	<p>My developement expertise is mostly web-related work. I don't really use back-ends anymore and just focus on the front-end now, as I cannot be bothered to run a server to host a back-end.</p>
	<p>Nowadays, if I want to make something I'll just bodge something together using JS, as I cannot be bothered to maintain proper codebases.</p>
	<p>Other than programming, I can do some system administration. I ran a fair share of Linux servers, from a homelab (which I still run to this day), to a VPS to host game servers and websites, as well as <u><a href="https://github.com/x-t/xyzanalytics">analytics (PHP)</a></u> data for me and a friend.</p>
