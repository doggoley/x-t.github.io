	<h2 class="c">About</h2>
	<p>I'm a 17 y/o high school student from Lithuania.</p>
	<p>I <em>used to be</em> a developer/sysadmin. Sometimes I do fire up a text editor and update my site or work on a project, however those days have become more and more far in-between.</p>
	<p>I made this website because I thought that it would be fun to maintain a page about myself. It's a lot more revealing than a social media profile, why don't you try it?</p>
	<p>My main interests are technology, music and just livin'. I'm a big music man, if I'm not listening to something right now, my mind is already humming something from memory. I don't play any instruments, and I don't really have any favorite genres.</p>

	<p>My most complex project was <u><a href="https://github.com/x-t/okforms">okforms</a></u>. It's a no-bullshit forms/polls creator and viewer, written in pure PHP from scratch.</p>
	<p>The piece of shit that made me the most headaches was <u><a href="https://github.com/x-t/ebin-dos">ebin-dos</a></u>. Mainly a hello world from an x86 bootloader.</p>
	<p>I contributed a bit to hackintoshing, I made EFI folders for the ThinkPad X220 to work with Lion, Mojave and Catalina. Find them in my Github or project archive.</p>
	<p>This website's repo itself is private, you can copy its code from view-source, I don't care.</p>
	<p>My developement expertise is mostly web-related work. I don't really use back-ends anymore and just focus on the front-end now, as I cannot be bothered to run a server to host a back-end.</p>
	<p>Nowadays, if I want to make something I'll just bodge something together using JS, as I cannot be bothered to maintain proper codebases.</p>
	<p>Other than programming, I can do some system administration. I ran a fair share of Linux servers, from a homelab (which I still run to this day), to a VPS to host game servers and websites, as well as <u><a href="https://github.com/x-t/xyzanalytics">analytics (PHP)</a></u> data for me and a friend.</p>
