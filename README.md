## Generation 4 of the personal website

Probably the most simple, yet best generation of the site yet. Although quite possibly, the last.

The website follows several design decisions

* **Single page** - the first page has to have all the information, about me, contacts, etc. This is contrast to generation 3, which required you to click on anything on the navbar to find anything. This is also better than generation 1, which gave out nothing but some contact info and a retarded bio.
* **Archive of past projects** - never seen before, a full list of public, still available (with copies of themselves/source code) projects.
* **Terry archive** - brought back from an easter egg in generation 3, publically.
* **Very, very shitty gallery** - JS script that creates a pretty nice-looking gallery, it's super customizable, super retarded, but very easily customizable.
* **No frameworks** - Vanilla CSS and JS only. Designed to survive a nuclear blast.
